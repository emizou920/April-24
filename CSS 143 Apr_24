This week is the last week to go slow, and the best time to review anything do not understand.

iphone = new MobilePhone("Apple", false, 1, "ATT");
this iphone is the reference
("Apple", false, 1, "ATT") this is the object

the value of the object is a reference and a reference is a address
If the fuction has a address as a parameter, it can change in the function

Big O, O(n), O(1)..
the o is called "order of"
